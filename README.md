# Prelude Libraries

Prelude maintains a collection of open-source libraries that interact with [Detect](https://support.preludesecurity.com/detect).

You must have a [Prelude Account](https://docs.preludesecurity.com/docs/prelude-account) to use these libraries. 

# What's here

Libraries are organized by language and categorized into Probes, SDK(s), and Tests.

## Probes
A [probe](https://support.preludesecurity.com/docs/probe-requirements) is an endpoint process that runs security tests. Probes are lightweight and open-source.

## CLI

The [Prelude CLI](https://support.preludesecurity.com/docs/prelude-cli) can interact with the Prelude Service API from the command line. 

## SDK

Software Development Kit (SDK) allows you to build your own tooling against the Prelude Service API. 

## Tests

Go / Tests are support libraries to centralize features for VSTs.
